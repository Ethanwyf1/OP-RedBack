## 📅 **Sprint 2 Plan (Weeks 5-8)**

---

### 🟩 **Week 5: UI Mockups & Interaction Design**

**Objective:**  
Translate prioritized user stories into low- to high-fidelity UI mockups to align team understanding and guide implementation.

**Key Activities:**  
- Design wireframes for key visualization screens:
  - PV-1: Preprocessing → Prelim transition view
  - PV-2: Prelim → Sifted feature selection view
  - PV-3: Sifted → 2D projection transition (Pilot)
  - AA-1: Algorithm performance comparison (Pythia)
  - DE-1: Web-based dashboard layout
- Present mockups for team review and feedback
- Begin storyboarding user flow interactions

**Output:**  
- Figma or Miro prototypes covering core interactions
- Mockups included in Wiki documentation

---

### 🟦 **Week 6: Technology Stack Confirmation & Environment Setup**

**Objective:**  
Finalize technical tools and prepare the development environment for rapid iteration.

**Key Activities:**  
- Evaluate and confirm tech stack (e.g., Streamlit vs Dash)
- Set up:
  - Local development environment (Python, Git, Virtualenv)
  - Basic repo structure
  - CI/CD (optional)
- Create initial Streamlit boilerplate with placeholder pages

**Output:**  
- Confirmed tech stack with justification
- Shared development setup instructions (in Wiki)
- Initial “Hello World” app running locally

---

### 🟨 **Week 7: Learning & Experimenting with Stack**

**Objective:**  
Ensure team members are comfortable with the selected stack before implementation begins.

**Key Activities:**  
- Complete short learning tasks:
  - Streamlit layout, component usage, and callbacks
  - Plotly/Altair integration with dummy data
  - Multi-page app setup
- Each member builds a small test visualization independently
- Share & discuss lessons learned at week-end

**Output:**  
- Mini prototypes with working charts/interactions
- Better understanding of reusable components

---

### 🟧 **Week 8: Foundational Implementation Begins**

**Objective:**  
Start building working prototypes of core user stories (Release 1 targets).

**Stories Targeted for Development:**
- PV-1: Preprocessing → Prelim visualization  
- PV-2: Feature selection impact visualization  
- AA-1: Displaying performance metrics from Pythia  
- DE-1: Deployable web interface skeleton  
- INT-2: Hover interactions for instance identification  

**Key Activities:**
- Implement UI structure and layout
- Connect real data outputs (e.g., projection matrices, metadata)
- Integrate first visual elements (scatter plots, bar charts)
- Set up interactions (hover, dropdown filters)

**Output:**
- Initial working version of the dashboard
- Preview ready for user feedback and iteration

> ✅ **Sprint 2 Deliverable Goal:**  
Functional visualization skeleton covering the core ISA pipeline stages with mock or initial data.
