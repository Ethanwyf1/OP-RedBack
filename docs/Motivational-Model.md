# DO/BE/FEEL Motivational Model  

## **Who (Stakeholders)**  
_List the primary stakeholders interacting with your system (e.g., users, administrators, developers)._  
- The Research Scientist
- Student
- Software Engineers
- System Administrators

## **DO (Functional Goals)**  
_What should the system accomplish? Identify key features and functionality._ 

Visualization & Analysis 
- [End-to-End Workflow Visualization – Display each stage of the model/package pipeline (pre-processing, prelim, sifted, pilot, cloister, Pythia, trace). ] 
- [Instance Space Exploration – Provide interactive plots to analyze distributions and performance trends.]
- [Model Comparison – Allow users to compare multiple experiment runs side by side.]
- [Custom Metrics & Filters – Enable filtering and sorting of results based on user-defined parameters.]

Integration & Data Handling
- [Export & Sharing – Allow users to export visualizations and reports (CSV, PNG, PDF).]
- [Result Caching – Store frequently accessed experiment results to reduce redundant computations and improve efficiency.]


Security & Access Control
- [User Authentication & Permissions – Login-based access with token authentication.]
- [Data Encryption – Secure sensitive experiment results to prevent unauthorized access.]
- [Secure API Endpoints – Protect data exchange between backend and frontend with authentication mechanisms.]


## **BE (Quality Goals)**  
_How should the system behave? Identify key quality attributes._  
- Secure  
- Accessible  
- Scalable  
- Easy to use
- Robust

## **FEEL (Emotional Goals - OPTIONAL)**  
_How should stakeholders feel when interacting with the system?_  
- Confident  
- Engaged  
- Supported
- Empowered

## **Motivational Model**  
_Based on the above lists, consider creating a simple Motivational Model diagram (e.g., using Miro, Draw.io) to represent the relationships between these elements._
