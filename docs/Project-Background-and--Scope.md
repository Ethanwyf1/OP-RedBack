## Project Scope

### Overview
The MATILDA Python-Native Dashboard project encompasses the development of a complete web interface for the Instance Space Analysis workflow, replacing the existing MATLAB-based solution. This document defines clear boundaries for what this project will and will not address.

### Client Definition
The client's primary users include researchers and data scientists who need more accessible tools for algorithm selection and analysis.

### Project Motivations
The current MATLAB-based solution presents several challenges for users, including:
- Difficulty tracking intermediate results through the analysis pipeline

By transitioning to a Python-native web interface, this project aims to:
- Democratize access to powerful algorithm selection tools
- Improve research efficiency through better visualization and workflow tracking
- Enhance collaboration capabilities through modern web technologies

### Scope Boundaries

#### In Scope
* Development of a web-based dashboard interface compatible with modern browsers
* Integration with the existing instancespace Python package
* Implementation of visualizations for all key stages of the analysis workflow
* User authentication and project management capabilities
* Data import/export functionality supporting common file formats
* Interactive result exploration with filtering and comparison tools
* Documentation and user guides for both end-users and future developers

#### Out of Scope
* Modifications to core algorithms within the instancespace package
* Changes to the underlying MATILDA platform infrastructure
* Integration with external analysis tools beyond the current workflow

### Success Criteria
* Complete processing of standard workflows previously handled by MATLAB
* User feedback indicating improved workflow visibility
* Comparable or improved performance metrics
* Enhanced accessibility of intermediate processing results
