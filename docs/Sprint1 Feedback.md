|-----:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1 | [Project Background]: The background outlines the transition from MATLAB to Python but lacks critical context about what MATILDA is, what problems it solves, and how it fits into a broader research workflow. The client is also not introduced.      | Negative | Zhang Xu                                                                                  | Done             | Expand the background to include what MATILDA is, its purpose, and clearly introduce the client and their relationship to the system. |
|   2 | [Client Goal]: The dashboard goal is stated, but without explaining the client or their context, the connection to real stakeholder needs appears disconnected and surface-level.                                                                       | Negative | Zhang Xu                                                                                  | Done             | Link the dashboard goal to the client‚Äôs actual needs and provide justification to strengthen stakeholder alignment.                |
|   3 | [Expected Impact on Stakeholders]: Stakeholders are listed and emotional goals outlined, but the link between features and actual benefits for each group is underdeveloped.                                                                            | Negative | Arulanantham Anujan Anandakumar                                                           | Done             | Clarify how each proposed feature translates into specific benefits for stakeholders.                                             |
|   4 | [User Stories]: Well-structured and logically grouped with strong alignment to goals and stakeholders. Good use of MoSCoW, sizing, and acceptance criteria.                                                                                             | Positive | Muath Almahasin, Yifei Wang, Arulanantham Anujan Anandakumar                              | No action needed  | Maintain story clarity and planning structure in future sprints.                                                                  |
|   5 | [Constraints]: Constraints such as time, tools, or project scope are not documented.                                                                                                                                                                    | Negative | Zhang Xu & Muath Almahasin                                                                                | Done             | Add a section in the documentation that clearly lists project constraints.                                                         |
|   6 | [User Stories]: The quantity of stories is impressive but may not be feasible for a student-led project.                                                                                                                                                | Negative | Muath Almahasin, Yifei Wang, Arulanantham Anujan Anandakumar                              | To do             | Review story volume and consider deferring or removing lower-priority tasks.                                                       |
|   7 | [README]: Clear, well-organized, includes team roles, branching strategy, and commit guidelines.                                                                                                                                                        | Positive | Yifei Wang, Abdulrahman Alaql, Zhang Xu                                                   | No action needed  | No action needed ‚Äî keep documentation quality high.                                                                                |
|   8 | [GitHub Project Board]: Board exists but needs better task-level tracking. Avoid vague cards or high-level placeholders.                                                                                                                                | Negative | Muath Almahasin, Arulanantham Anujan Anandakumar                                          | To do             | Break large cards into actionable items and ensure the board reflects actual task progress.                                       |
|   9 | [Workflow]: The GitFlow branch names are listed but branching practices, merge rules, and CI/CD steps are not explained.                                                                                                                               | Negative | Yifei Wang/Zhang Xu                                                                                 | Done             | Document the complete development workflow including collaboration, CI, testing, and release procedures.                          |
|  10 | [Environment Setup]: No environment setup instructions included, which may impact onboarding or reproducibility.                                                                                                                                         | Negative | Abdulrahman Alaql                                                                         | To do             | Add a setup section in the README (even as a placeholder) with installation instructions or dependencies.                         |
|  11 | [Changelog]: GitHub Releases are used, but there is no reference to them in the README.                                                                                                                                                                | Negative | Abdulrahman Alaql                                                                         | To do             | Add a note in the README to guide readers to GitHub Releases for the changelog.                                                    |
|  12 | [User Story Map]: Strong mapping to team responsibilities. Clearly supports Sprint 2 planning. Sprint ceremonies are documented.                                                                                                                        | Positive | Muath Almahasin, Yifei Wang, Arulanantham Anujan Anandakumar                              | No action needed  | No action needed ‚Äî maintain current structure.                                                                                     |
|  13 | [Sprint 2 Planning]: Stories selected without justification of priority or effort estimation, which limits assessment of feasibility.                                                                                                                  | Negative | Muath Almahasin, Yifei Wang, Arulanantham Anujan Anandakumar                              | To do             | Provide rationale for selected user stories and include time/effort estimates.                                                     |
|  14 | [Validation Video]: Strong segment with meaningful stakeholder engagement and feedback.                                                                                                                                                                | Positive | Yifei Wang, Zhang Xu                                                                      | No action needed  | No action needed ‚Äî continue with active engagement practices.                                                                      |
|  15 | [Validation Video]: No project introduction or explanation of prototype scope, which reduces clarity for external viewers.                                                                                                                              | Negative | Yifei Wang, Zhang Xu                                                                      | To do             | Add a short intro to the video explaining project context, user roles, and what is being demonstrated.                             |
|  16 | [Validation Video]: A silent segment reduces clarity. Viewers don‚Äôt know what is being tested.                                                                                                                                                         | Negative | Yifei Wang, Zhang Xu                                                                      | To do             | Add voiceover or captions to explain what's happening during silent prototype interactions.                                        |
|  17 | [General Feedback]: Great structure and progress, but improve workflow explanation, environment setup, and Sprint 2 justification.                                                                                                                     | Positive | Muath Almahasin, Abdulrahman Alaql, Arulanantham Anujan Anandakumar, Yifei Wang, Zhang Xu | No action needed  | No action needed on structure ‚Äî focus upcoming work on estimation clarity and workflow documentation.                             |
