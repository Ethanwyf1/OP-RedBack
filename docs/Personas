## 🧠 AI-Generated User Personas

> **Disclaimer:**  
> The following user personas were generated using AI (ChatGPT by OpenAI) to reflect the primary user types relevant to the OPTIMA Dashboard project. These fictional profiles are based on realistic assumptions aligned with the project's goals and intended audience.

### 💬 Prompt Used

> _Create three user personas for the OPTIMA Dashboard project, a Python-based web interface using the `instancespace` package. The target users are researchers and data scientists focused on algorithm selection and analysis._

### 👩‍🔬 Persona 1: Dr. Li Wen – The Algorithm Researcher

- **Age:** 41  
- **Role:** Senior Researcher in Machine Learning  
- **Background:**  
  Li specializes in algorithm selection and meta-learning. She uses the `instancespace` Python package in her daily research and contributes to academic publications. She needs to dive deep into model behavior and comparative analysis.

#### 🎯 Goals
- Analyze and compare algorithm performance across diverse instance spaces  
- Quickly interpret intermediate results and performance trends  
- Export publication-ready visuals and data summaries  

#### ❌ Pain Points
- The current command-line interface of `instancespace` is powerful but not intuitive  
- Workflow lacks visual feedback for each stage of analysis  
- Needs better traceability between data pre-processing, feature extraction, and final results  

#### 🧰 Tech Skills
Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Git, Matplotlib  

> _“I want to understand how each decision in the pipeline affects the outcome — visually and clearly.”_

### 🧑‍💻 Persona 2: Alex Rivera – Applied Data Scientist

- **Age:** 29  
- **Role:** Data Scientist at a Tech Company  
- **Background:**  
  Alex uses the `instancespace` package to evaluate models for production deployment. He values speed, usability, and clarity when comparing algorithm behavior across operational datasets.

#### 🎯 Goals
- Explore instance space distributions interactively  
- Compare model performance with filters and constraints  
- Use a dashboard to demo insights to non-technical stakeholders  

#### ❌ Pain Points
- Prefers GUI-based tools over CLI or scripting-only environments  
- Finds it difficult to share experiment results with peers without screenshots or notebooks  
- Needs simplified workflows and documentation  

#### 🧰 Tech Skills
Python, Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit, Docker  

> _“Give me something visual, fast, and exportable — I need to explain models to people without a PhD.”_

### 🎓 Persona 3: Sara Mansour – The Graduate Student Explorer

- **Age:** 24  
- **Role:** Master’s Student in Data Science  
- **Background:**  
  Sara is writing her thesis on automated algorithm selection. She’s using the `instancespace` package for the first time and is looking for an interactive and educational interface to help her learn and explore.

#### 🎯 Goals
- Follow the full pipeline step-by-step with clear explanations  
- Visualize feature space and performance data intuitively  
- Access learning resources and examples within the dashboard  

#### ❌ Pain Points
- Overwhelmed by code-based experimentation workflows  
- Struggles with debugging or interpreting results from scripts alone  
- Needs straightforward onboarding and self-guided tutorials  

#### 🧰 Tech Skills
Python (intermediate), Google Colab, Excel, Seaborn  

> _“If I can see the process, I can understand it — a visual guide would save me hours of guesswork.”_
