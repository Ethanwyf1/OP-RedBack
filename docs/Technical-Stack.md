## üß∞ Technology Stack Selection

---

### ‚úÖ Primary Choice: Streamlit

#### ‚úÖ Advantages

- **Seamless Integration with the Existing Python Project**  
  Streamlit is a pure Python framework, making it easy to integrate directly into the current `pyInstanceSpace` codebase.  
  _Example:_ You can load projection results from `PilotStage` and display them in a 2D scatter plot with minimal code.

- **Rich Data Visualization Support**  
  Supports libraries like Plotly, Altair, and Matplotlib.  
  _Use Cases:_  
  - Visualize instance projections from `PilotStage` as scatter plots  
  - Show algorithm performance metrics from `PythiaStage` as bar charts or tables  
  - Render algorithm footprints from `TraceStage` as layered region overlays

- **Interactive Controls for Exploratory Analysis**  
  Built-in UI elements (dropdowns, sliders, checkboxes) allow researchers to explore data dynamically.  
  _Example:_ Select an algorithm from a dropdown to view its footprint, or adjust a slider to filter results.

- **Multi-Page Structure for Modular Design**  
  Each stage (e.g., preprocessing, projection, trace) can be displayed on its own page, keeping the interface clean.

- **Fast Local Development & Easy Deployment**  
  Run locally via `streamlit run app.py`. Can deploy via Streamlit Community Cloud, Docker, Heroku, etc.  
  _Example:_ Team members can access the dashboard via a simple URL without installing Python.

- **Rapid Development with Minimal Code**  
  Features hot-reloading and concise syntax‚Äîideal for research with evolving needs.

- **Low Learning Curve with Quality Learning Resources**

### üîÅ Alternative Option: Dash (by Plotly)

#### ‚úÖ Advantages

- Python-based full-stack solution ‚Äî no JavaScript needed  
- Strong Plotly integration with advanced interactivity (brushing, linking, filtering)  
- Modular architecture and reusable layout components  
- Fine-grained control over layout  
- Easy deployment with WSGI servers and containers

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages

- Steeper learning curve with a complex callback system  
- More verbose syntax for simple components  
- Requires manual CSS/HTML styling  
- Multi-page support is less abstracted ‚Äî large projects need more manual structuring

### üß± Advanced Option: React (Frontend) + FastAPI (Backend)

#### ‚úÖ Advantages

- Maximum flexibility for scalable, responsive applications  
- Clear separation of frontend and backend for team collaboration and future reuse  
- Full UI customization with React (layout, animation, responsiveness)  
- FastAPI is async-ready and provides automatic OpenAPI documentation  
- Easily supports authentication, background tasks, and dashboards

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages

- Higher development complexity (needs JS/TS + Python skills)  
- Longer setup and dev time due to boilerplate and configuration  
- Requires more team coordination  
- May be overkill for small or short-term research tools
