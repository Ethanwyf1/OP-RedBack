## Task Estimation Process


### ‚è∞ Estimation Process
In our estimation process, we use the **Fibonacci Sequence** to determine the effort required for each task. The sequence represents the number of **man-days** required to complete a task, where each number corresponds to the complexity and size of the task.

### Fibonacci Sequence:
- 1: Very small task (1 day)
- 2: Small task (2 days)
- 3: Medium task (3 days)
- 5: Large task (5 days)
- 8: Very large task (8 days)
- 13: Huge task (13 days)

### Steps in the Estimation Process:

1. **Assign Team Members to Backlog Items**:
   - Each backlog item is assigned to a specific subgroup within the project team. Each subgroup is responsible for estimating the effort for their respective tasks.
   
2. **Individual Estimation**:
   - Each team member in the subgroup independently estimates the effort required for each task using the Fibonacci sequence. These estimates should reflect the **number of man-days** each member thinks the task will take.

3. **Discussion & Consensus**:
   - If there is a **disagreement** on the effort estimate between team members, a discussion should take place to understand the reasoning behind each estimate.
   - Team members present their thought process and explain why they believe the task should take the number of days they assigned.
   - The goal is to **convince others** and come to a consensus on the most realistic estimate.

4. **Final Estimation**:
   - After discussion, the team agrees on the final effort estimate for each task. If consensus cannot be reached, the item may be revisited or the team may decide to go with an average estimate.

5. **Update Backlog**:
   - Once all items are estimated, the backlog is updated with the final effort estimates.
