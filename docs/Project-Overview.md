# Project Overview

## Project Name: [OPTIMA Database]

## Project Introduction
The MATILDA experimentation platform has traditionally relied on MATLAB-based software for result generation and visualization. However, with the recent development of the `instancespace` Python package, our project aims to transition towards a Python-native dashboard that provides an interactive and streamlined experience for visualizing the various stages of model processing.


## Objective

To develop a modular and user-friendly Python dashboard that supports the entire MATILDA analysis pipeline, enhancing researchers' ability to visualize, interpret, and interact with data at each stage of the workflow.

### Client Definition
The client's primary users include researchers and data scientists who need more accessible tools for algorithm selection and analysis.
