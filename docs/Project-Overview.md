# Project Overview

## Project Name: [OPTIMA Database]

## Project Introduction
The MATILDA experimentation platform has traditionally relied on MATLAB-based software for result generation and visualization. However, with the recent development of the `instancespace` Python package, our project aims to transition towards a Python-native dashboard that provides an interactive and streamlined experience for visualizing the various stages of model processing.


## Key Features
- **End-to-End Visualization**: Displays each stage of the modeling process, including data pre-processing, feature extraction, model execution, and result interpretation.
- **Integration with `instancespace`**: Utilizes the newly developed Python package to generate and analyze results.
- **Interactive UI**: Enables real-time exploration of instance space distributions and performance trends.
- **Modular Design**: Allows for easy extension and adaptation to different experimentation needs.

## Project Goal
_The primary goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly Python dashboard that integrates with `instancespace` to visualize and analyze the entire workflowâ€”from pre-processing to final results. This will provide researchers with better insight into intermediate steps and enable more efficient debugging and decision-making._
