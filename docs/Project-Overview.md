# Project Overview

## Project Name: [OPTIMA Database]

## Project Introduction

Traditionally, the MATILDA (Melbourne Algorithm Test Instance Library with Data Analytics) platform has used MATLAB-based tools for generating results and creating visualizations. Developed at the University of Melbourne, it offers a rich online library of benchmark problem instances alongside built-in analytics for evaluating algorithm performance. Through its web interface, users can effortlessly download benchmark datasets, access archived algorithm results and instance features, and download the MATLAB engine for local, offline analysis.

However, with the recent development of the `instancespace` Python package, our project aims to transition towards a Python-native dashboard that provides an interactive and streamlined experience for visualizing the various stages of model processing. More specifically, we aim to develop a platform that allows users to load metadata—such as instance features and algorithm lists—so they can perform instance space analysis and identify the most suitable algorithm for a given data space. This dashboard provides greater flexibility, allowing users to select and adjust parameters—such as choosing their own features—without being limited by decisions made in earlier stages like preprocessing or preliminary analysis.


## Objective

To develop a modular and user-friendly Python dashboard that supports the entire MATILDA analysis pipeline, enhancing researchers' ability to visualize, interpret, and interact with data at each stage of the workflow. The dashboard will offer flexible tools for loading and exploring metadata—such as instance features and algorithm sets—and will allow users to perform multi-stage instance space analysis with the ability to dynamically adjust parameters at each stage.

### Client Definition
The client's primary users include researchers and data scientists who need more accessible tools for algorithm selection and analysis.

### Indutry Partner/Client
- Dr. Mario Andrés Muñoz Acosta is a Research Fellow (Level B) at the ARC Centre in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications (OPTIMA) and the School of Computer and Information Systems at The University of Melbourne.
- His research expertise spans optimisation, computational intelligence, signal processing, data analysis, and machine learning methods applied to complex problems in science, engineering, and medicine.
- As a core member of the MATILDA team, he brings deep knowledge of multi-stage instance space analysis and algorithm performance visualization to steer the dashboard’s design toward real research workflows.

### Client’s Goals

- **Adopt a Python‐native ecosystem**  
  Replace the MATLAB engine and toolboxes with the `instancespace` Python package so that all stages of instance‐space analysis can be installed and run in a single Python environment.

- **Empower interactive, parameter‐driven workflows**  
  Allow users to upload custom metadata (instance features, algorithm lists) and expose all key hyperparameters (e.g. correlation thresholds, cluster count, GA settings, density filters) via intuitive UI controls, enabling on‐the‐fly adjustments without rerunning the entire pipeline.

- **Align with real research pipelines in OPTIMA**  
  Mirror the multi‐stage process (preprocessing → preliminary analysis → sifted feature selection → pilot evaluation) used by Dr. Muñoz Acosta, surfacing intermediate diagnostics (correlation matrices, silhouette scores, cluster assignments) for power users to inspect and validate each step.

- **Ensure reproducibility and shareability**  
  Provide download/export buttons for data tables, plots, and configuration snapshots (CSV/JSON/PNG), and record both raw inputs and final outputs to support archiving alongside academic publications.

- **Deliver research‐grade visualizations**  
  Replicate the high‐quality, publication‐ready plots generated by the original MATILDA MATLAB toolkit in an interactive web UI, with options to export figures (PNG/SVG) and raw data for seamless integration into reports and presentations.
