## OP-RedBack

Welcome to the official repository for the **OP-RedBack**. This project aims to replace the existing MATLAB-based system used by OPTIMA researchers with an interactive, modular, and user-friendly Python-based dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard that visualizes and supports the Instance Space Analysis package workflow using Python technologies like Streamlit. It enables researchers to:

- Visualize and analyze algorithm performance across different stages
- Interact with projection data and adjust parameters iteratively
- Explore and filter datasets without deep technical overhead

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```bash
├── docs/                # Documentation files (copied from the Wiki)
├── src/                 # Source code (to be added in Sprint 2)
└── README.md            # Overview, repo layout, guidelines, and changelog
```

- `docs/` contains project documentation such as user stories, requirements, and the motivational model.
- `src/` will contain Python source code, visualizations, and Streamlit app components in Sprint 2.
- `README.md` is updated across sprints and contains this project summary, structure, workflow, and changelog.

## 🚦 GitHub Workflow (Sprint 1)

We follow a **GitFlow**-based branching strategy:

- `master` – stable release
- `develop` – main development branch
- `feature/<name>` – for new features
- `release/<sprint>` – for packaging deliverables
- `hotfix/<issue>` – for urgent fixes

✅ Commit messages follow this format:  
`<type>(<scope>): <short description>`

| Type      | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| feat      | New feature                            |
| fix       | Bug fix                                |
| docs      | Documentation only                     |
| style     | Formatting, no logic change            |
| refactor  | Code restructuring without behavior    |
| test      | Adding or updating tests               |
| chore     | Maintenance tasks                      |
