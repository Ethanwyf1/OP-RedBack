## OP-RedBack

Welcome to the official repository for the **OP-RedBack**. This project aims to replace the existing MATLAB-based system used by OPTIMA researchers with an interactive, modular, and user-friendly Python-based dashboard.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard that visualizes and supports the Instance Space Analysis package workflow using Python technologies like Streamlit. It enables researchers to:

- Visualize and analyze algorithm performance across different stages
- Interact with projection data and adjust parameters iteratively
- Explore and filter datasets without deep technical overhead

---

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `pip` (comes with Python)
- Virtual environment tool (`venv` or `conda` recommended)

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FEIT-COMP90082-2025-SM1/OP-RedBack.git
cd OP-RedBack
```

#### 2. Set up and activate the virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

> Then open the URL in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

## Repository Structure

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                # Documentation files (copied from the Wiki)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                 # Source code (to be added in Sprint 2)
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Overview, repo layout, guidelines, and changelog
```

- `docs/` contains project documentation such as user stories, requirements, and the motivational model.
- `src/` will contain Python source code, visualizations, and Streamlit app components in Sprint 2.
- `README.md` is updated across sprints and contains this project summary, structure, workflow, and changelog.

## GitHub Workflow (Sprint 1)

We follow a **GitFlow**-based branching strategy:

- `master` â€“ stable release
- `develop` â€“ main development branch
- `feature/<name>` â€“ for new features
- `release/<sprint>` â€“ for packaging deliverables
- `hotfix/<issue>` â€“ for urgent fixes

 Commit messages follow this format:  
`<type>(<scope>): <short description>`

| Type      | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| feat      | New feature                            |
| fix       | Bug fix                                |
| docs      | Documentation only                     |
| style     | Formatting, no logic change            |
| refactor  | Code restructuring without behavior    |
| test      | Adding or updating tests               |
| chore     | Maintenance tasks                      |
